## About the Project

GameHub is a front-end web development project built entirely using HTML and CSS. The primary goal
is to simulate an e-commerce platform where users can browse, purchase games, and sell back old titles.
This was created as part of a school assignment with a focus on visual design and user experience, without any
functionality implemented.
No external frameworks was used in this project.

### Purpose

- Showcase clean and responsive web design principles.
- Prioritize ease of navigation and a seamless user experience.
- Create an engaging layout that conveys the theme of gaming and commerce.

## Features

- Game Catalog: A product page displaying all games on offer.
- Purchase: Seamless and easy to use purchase
- Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on desktop, tablets and mobile devices.
- Navigation bar: Easy-to-use navigation links for home, browse games, about and contact pages.
- Footer: Contains links to everything related to GameHub

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Structure and content.
- CSS3: Styling and layout, including responsive design.
