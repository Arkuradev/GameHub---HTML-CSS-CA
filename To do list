To-do list as of 28th of January 2024: 

1. Finish the payment pages and link them together so I can go through the purchase flow. 
2. Fix the basket page on mobile to have the Quantity, Price and Total section listed differently to look better for the viewer. 
2. Remake the footer as this is mostly followed through a tutorial and not made completely on my own. - Completed!
3. Finish the index.html page. 
4. Make corrections to the contact page to have both colored divs equal size. 
5. Resize all images to take up as little space as possible. 
6. Finish the about page. 
7.
